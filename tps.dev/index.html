    <h1>Thinker. Creator. Agile.</h1>
    <p>
        I am a university-trained Engineer, with over a decade of experience in the transport sector. I began my journey working in the railway industry before moving into aviation.<br><br>This past year I have taken a side-step out of work to complete a Software Development course at CodeClan in Glasgow. Software Development felt like a natural progression for me as it plays to my strengths and mindset.
        Being a thinker and a creator, I have a keen interest in full-stack development with a lean towards front-end. This gives me the opportunity to apply my engineering discipline and also flex my creativity.<br><br>I am Agile trained and have worked in a number of different Agile roles in my career. I am a huge advocate of this way of working as it aligns with my work ethos. Whilst at CodeClan I have found it particularly beneficial to adopt an Agile approach to working and have enjoyed showing the benefits to others.<br><br>I am lucky to live in Scotland which allows me to practice my hobbies; hill walking (with my wife and dogs), photography and oil painting.
