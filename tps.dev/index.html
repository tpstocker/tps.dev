    <h1>Thinker. Creator. Diplomat.</h1>
    <p>I was once asked in an interview how I would describe myself in three words. In the heat of the moment I bumbled out some terrible words which I can’t recall. However, I can remember saying to myself “Tom, why the hell did you say that?”.<br>
        Having time to reflect, I should have said Thinker, Creator and Diplomat.<br>
        I am a university-trained Engineer, with over a decade of experience in the transport sector. However, I have recently taken a step out of work to complete a Software Development course at CodeClan in Glasgow.<br>
        Being a thinker and a creator, I have a keen interest in full-stack development with a lean towards front-end. This gives me the opportunity to apply my engineering discipline and also flex my creativity.<br><br>
        I am lucky to live in Scotland which allows me to practice my hobbies; hill walking (with my wife and dogs), photography and oil painting.</p>
